> Place fetched git repositories at arbitrary paths via symlink or copy.

nput is a Nix library and module set that **places the contents of an already-fetched
Nix store path at a `root`-relative target** — as a symlink or a copy. It does **not**
generate configuration. It puts a repository's contents where you ask, untouched.

The core is a **placement primitive**: a pure function that places a Nix store path at a
`root`-relative `target`. It is not hidden behind a module abstraction — you compose it
directly. `home.file`-style placement (`root` = `$HOME`) is just one application; `root`
is chosen explicitly with the `projectRoot` / `homeRoot` / `systemRoot` markers (there is
**no implicit default**).

> **Status: MVP / implementation phase.** The implemented scope is the standalone CLI +
> **project mode** as the core, with **home mode** also supported. NixOS / nix-darwin
> modules and **system mode** are future work. See [MVP status](#mvp-status) for the full
> matrix. APIs may still change.

## Why nput

Nix can *fetch* a repository (`fetchFromGitHub`, `fetchGit`, flake inputs, npins, …) but
*placing* its contents onto the filesystem is a separate problem. The usual answers all
have costs:

- **home-manager `home.file`** places files, but requires home-manager and assumes a
  *whole-environment* model: one `home-manager switch` updates everything at once, so one
  change can ripple across — or break — unrelated tools. The file module cannot be
  extracted as a standalone library.
- **A shell `git clone`** works but loses version pinning, reproducibility, and Nix
  integration.
- **Module abstractions** (home-manager / NixOS / nix-darwin / system-manager) declare
  placement through the Nix module system and hide the behavior behind an abstraction,
  translating to a platform-native mechanism (`home.file`, `systemd.tmpfiles`, …). That
  takes the control of "what goes where, and how" out of your hands and duplicates
  behavior per layer.

nput separates **fetching** (Nix evaluation: `src` is a store path) from **placement**
(a fixed runtime engine), and keeps placement behavior in a **single core** that you drive
explicitly:

- **No configuration generation.** nput never translates module options into config
  files. It places what the repository already contains.
- **Independent units.** Each placement config (`nput.<name>`) is its own Nix profile.
  Update and apply each role independently — one update never ripples to another.
- **No home-manager dependency.** The `lib/` core depends only on nixpkgs. It runs
  standalone; module integrations (home-manager, devShell, future NixOS/nix-darwin) are
  thin wiring that only *kick* the engine — they never place files themselves.
- **A self-recorded manifest, not readlink pattern-matching.** nput's placement engine
  tracks what it placed in a manifest from the previous generation, so it can safely
  auto-migrate cases home-manager's `home.file` (as of 2026-07) cannot — e.g. a per-file
  target becoming a directory symlink. See [`docs/concept.md`](docs/concept.md#home-manager-homefile-との配置意味論の差)
  for the full comparison.

---

## How it works

nput has two layers:

```
[nput CLI]  packages.nput — on PATH, the primary UX
  · discovers an entrypoint (flake.nix / shell.nix / default.nix)
  · runs `nix build` / `nix eval` internally to obtain a named manifest
  · drives the engine to place, prune stale links, and swap the profile
   ↓ manifest.json
[engine]    a Go library (stdlib-only)
  · takes manifest.json as input; invokes only `nix` (profile) and `git` (toplevel)
  · native filesystem operations for place / replace / remove + conservative stale removal
```

- The **engine** owns placement and stale removal. It reads `manifest.json` — the stable
  Nix↔Go contract — and performs native filesystem operations.
- `lib.mkManifest` is a **pure function** that produces a link-farm derivation
  (`manifest.json` + a symlink farm). It has no side effects.
- An **entrypoint** is the Nix file the CLI reads (`flake.nix`, `shell.nix`, or
  `default.nix`); it exposes a named manifest under `nput.<name>`. The config is still
  written in Nix and evaluated by `nix build`.

---

## Requirements

- **Nix** with experimental features enabled in your environment:
  `experimental-features = nix-command` (and `flakes` for flake entrypoints).
  nput does **not** silently inject `--extra-experimental-features`; if a feature is not
  enabled it stops with a clear message explaining the prerequisite and how to enable it.
- **git** on `PATH` (used to resolve the project root in project mode).

---

## Install

### Standalone (home mode)

Install the CLI globally so `nput` is on `PATH`:

```bash
nix profile install github:yasunori0418/nput
```

To avoid `schemaVersion` skew, align the CLI and the `nput` your flake pins to the **same
input** (the global CLI and your flake's `nput.lib` are otherwise separate inputs that can
drift; the engine rejects a `schemaVersion` newer than its own).

### Project mode (canonical: pin in the devShell)

For project mode, the canonical form is to **bundle a pinned `nput`** in the project's
devShell so the CLI and `nput.lib` come from the same flake input (locked by `flake.lock`):

```nix
devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
  packages  = [ nput.packages.${system}.nput ];   # pinned nput on PATH
  shellHook = "nput apply <name> --no-wait";        # placed on `nix develop` / direnv entry
};
```

### Scaffold a new project

`nput init` is a transparent wrapper over `nix flake init -t`; nput itself generates
nothing, and existing files are never overwritten:

```bash
nput init standalone   # homeRoot example
nput init project      # projectRoot example + devShell wiring + .gitignore guide
```

---

## Quickstart

### Project mode (the central use)

In **project mode** the root is the project root (the git toplevel). Placements are
**ephemeral** — regenerated on each clone, never committed — so activation never touches
git state. This is the central way to use nput: embed it in a repo and place store paths
at arbitrary in-repo paths, kicked from a devShell.

```nix
# flake.nix — entering the repo places .claude/skills/nix from a fetched store path
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  inputs.nput.url    = "github:yasunori0418/nput";

  inputs.claude-skills.url   = "github:someone/claude-skills";
  inputs.claude-skills.flake = false;

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, nput, ... }@inputs:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs   = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
    in
    {
      nput.${system}.skills = nput.lib.mkManifest {
        inherit pkgs;
        root = nput.lib.projectRoot;        # resolves to the git toplevel at runtime
        entries = {
          ".claude/skills/nix" = { src = inputs.claude-skills; subpath = "skills/nix"; };
        };
      };

      devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
        packages  = [ nput.packages.${system}.nput ];   # pinned nput (canonical)
        shellHook = "nput apply skills --no-wait";       # place on shell entry
      };
    };
}
```

```bash
# Enter the shell — the placement runs automatically via the shellHook
nix develop          # or: direnv allow

# List the targets the project owner should add to .gitignore (stdout only; no writes)
nput gitignore skills >> .gitignore
```

- `--root <path>` overrides the resolved root in any mode (escape hatch for git-less
  trees, debugging, etc.).
- Generations are an internal mechanism here; `rollback` / `list-generations` are **not**
  exposed in project mode (rollback is meaningless for ephemeral placements).
- In a devShell, use a **named apply** (`nput apply skills`) or
  `nput apply --all --project-root`. A bare `--all` would also place any home-mode configs
  into `$HOME` — a footgun in mixed entrypoints.

### Home mode (standalone, roles as separate profiles)

In **home mode** the root is `$HOME`, selected with `homeRoot`. Each config is its own
profile, committed every apply, with user-facing `rollback`.

```nix
# flake.nix — each role is a named manifest = an independent profile
outputs.nput.${system} = {
  vim-plugins = nput.lib.mkManifest {
    inherit pkgs;
    root = nput.lib.homeRoot;
    entries = {
      ".local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/start/foo" = { src = inputs.vim-foo; };
      ".local/share/nvim/site/pack/bar/start/bar" = { src = inputs.vim-bar; };
    };
  };

  zsh-plugins = nput.lib.mkManifest {
    inherit pkgs;
    root = nput.lib.homeRoot;
    entries = {
      ".zsh/plugins/autosuggestions"     = { src = inputs.zsh-autosuggestions; };
      ".zsh/plugins/syntax-highlighting" = { src = inputs.zsh-syntax-highlighting; };
    };
  };
};
```

```bash
# Update / apply / roll back each role independently (separate profiles)
nput apply vim-plugins
nput rollback vim-plugins          # home mode only
nput apply zsh-plugins
nput list-generations vim-plugins
```

After updating a `src` (a flake input update, `npins update`, …), re-apply only the
affected config to keep the change from touching any other tool.

### home-manager module

The module pins `root = homeRoot` (you do not re-specify `root`). It kicks the engine from
`home.activation` via `nput apply --manifest <link-farm>` — it never delegates to
`home.file`. nput keeps its own profile as an **internal mechanism**; user-facing rollback
is unified on the host (`home-manager --rollback`).

```nix
imports = [ inputs.nput.homeManagerModules.default ];

nput = {
  enable = true;
  entries = {
    # external repo (store link)
    ".claude/skills/nix" = { src = inputs.skills-repo; subpath = "skills/nix"; };
    # theme as a copy (place-once, then user-managed)
    ".local/share/themes/dark" = { src = inputs.themes; subpath = "dark"; method = "copy"; };
    # live editing of local dotfiles via out-of-store symlink
    ".config/nvim" = { src = nput.lib.mkOutOfStoreSymlink "/home/me/dotfiles"; subpath = "home/.config/nvim"; };
  };
};
```

> The home-manager module is a **single manifest = one profile** (fixed name `default`) in
> the MVP — it has no `<name>` dimension, so **role separation is not available through the
> module**. Use the standalone CLI path (`nput.<name>` entrypoints) for multiple
> independent profiles.

### Adding nput to an existing flake

`nput init` is for new projects. To retrofit an existing `flake.nix`, do these four steps
by hand (nput never auto-merges your flake — "do not generate configuration"):

1. **Add the input**: `inputs.nput.url = "github:yasunori0418/nput";`
2. **Expose a manifest**:
   `outputs.nput.<system>.<name> = nput.lib.mkManifest { root = nput.lib.projectRoot; entries = { ... }; };`
3. **Bundle pinned nput in the devShell**: `packages = [ nput.packages.${system}.nput ];`
4. **Wire a named apply**: `shellHook = "nput apply <name> --no-wait";`

If the repo uses **flake-parts**, write step 2 via the flake module instead (keeps `pkgs`
consistent with `perSystem`):

```nix
imports = [ inputs.nput.flakeModules.default ];
perSystem = { pkgs, ... }: {
  nput.<name> = inputs.nput.lib.mkManifest {
    inherit pkgs;
    root = inputs.nput.lib.projectRoot;
    entries = { ... };
  };
};
# flake-parts transposes this to flake.nput.<system>.<name> — the CLI addressing is unchanged.
```

> `nix flake check` reports `warning: unknown flake output 'nput'` but exits 0 (harmless,
> expected — the `nput` namespace keeps manifests out of `packages`). Verify artifacts with
> `nix build .#nput.<system>.<name>`.

---

## `entries` schema

`entries` is an **attrset keyed by `target`** — the attribute key is the identifier and
supplies the default `target`. Uniqueness is guaranteed natively by Nix attrset keys; there
is no manual `name` field.

```nix
entries = {
  "<target>" = {
    src     = ...;          # required
    subpath = ".";          # optional, default "." (the whole repository)
    target  = "<target>";   # optional, default = the attribute key
    method  = "symlink";    # optional, default "symlink" | "copy"
  };
  # ...
};
```

The entry submodule is **strict** (unknown keys are rejected); typos and old names
(`name` / `source` / `dir` / `mode`) are evaluation-time errors.

### `src` — required

The placement source. The default is a **store link** (a symlink into the Nix store, which
guarantees reproducibility). Out-of-store is opt-in via an explicit marker.

| `src` value | Symlink points to | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `path` (e.g. `inputs.myrepo`) | Nix store (immutable) | version-pinned external repo |
| `builtins.path { path = /home/...; name = "..."; }` | Nix store (local copied in) | a local tree via the store |
| `set` (e.g. `pkgs.fetchFromGitHub { ... }`) | Nix store (immutable) | version-pinned external repo |
| `marker` (`nput.lib.mkOutOfStoreSymlink "/abs/path"`) | local FS (live) | local dotfiles under development |

```nix
src = inputs.myrepo;                                    # store link
src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub { owner = "..."; repo = "..."; rev = "..."; hash = "..."; };
src = builtins.path { path = /path/to/dotfiles; name = "dotfiles"; };
src = nput.lib.mkOutOfStoreSymlink "/path/to/dotfiles"; # out-of-store (live), explicit

# Removed: passing a bare string for implicit out-of-store is not supported.
# src = "/path/to/dotfiles";   # error
```

### `subpath` — default `"."`

The relative path selecting which path **inside `src`** to take. Works for files and
directories. Omitting it (or `"."`) selects the whole repository.

```nix
subpath = ".";                  # whole repository (explicit form)
subpath = "skills/nix";         # a subdirectory
subpath = "themes/dark.json";   # a single file
```

`src` and `subpath` are orthogonal: `src` = *which thing* (store path / repository),
`subpath` = *which path inside it*.

### `target` — default = the attribute key

The destination, **relative to `root`**. The attribute key is the default `target` and is
also the entry's identity (the diff key for stale removal, and its uniqueness key). You can
make the key a logical label and override `target` explicitly (like `home.file`).

### `method` — default `"symlink"`

Selects the placement kind:

| `method` | `src` kind | Behavior | Generations |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"symlink"` | path / set | symlink into the Nix store (read-only) | yes (profile) |
| `"symlink"` | marker | out-of-store symlink to a local path (live) | yes (link target only) |
| `"copy"` | path / set | **place-once** copy (writable, user-managed) | **no** |
| `"copy"` | marker | evaluation-time error (contradictory) | — |

**copy is place-once and user-managed.** Once materialized, nput does not touch the target.
The store's read-only mode (`0444` / `0555`) is preserved but owner-write is added so the
copy is editable. To follow an upstream `src` update, use `nput apply --recopy` (overwrites
all copy targets unconditionally) or `nput reset` then re-apply. Copies are not generation-
managed and are never rolled back. If a foreign real file already occupies a copy target,
nput skips it but emits a **warning** (it never overwrites your file).

### Generating entries dynamically

Interpolate names into the target key. Derive the target from a variable **you** control —
not from `baseNameOf src` (a store path resolves to `/nix/store/<hash>-source`, so
`baseNameOf` yields `<hash>-source`):

```nix
let plugins = [ "telescope" "treesitter" "cmp" ]; in
nput.lib.mkManifest {
  inherit pkgs;
  root = nput.lib.homeRoot;
  entries = builtins.listToAttrs (map (n: {
    name  = ".local/share/nvim/site/pack/plugins/start/${n}";  # key = target
    value = { src = inputs.${n}; };
  }) plugins);
}
```

To enumerate subdirectories, `builtins.readDir` an **already-realised store path /
`flake = false` input** (a raw `fetchFromGitHub` derivation would trigger import-from-
derivation and break pure flake eval):

```nix
let
  skills = builtins.readDir "${inputs.claude-skills}/skills";
  names  = builtins.attrNames (nixpkgs.lib.filterAttrs (_: t: t == "directory") skills);
in
nput.lib.mkManifest {
  inherit pkgs;
  root = nput.lib.homeRoot;
  entries = builtins.listToAttrs (map (n: {
    name  = ".claude/skills/${n}";
    value = { src = inputs.claude-skills; subpath = "skills/${n}"; };
  }) names);
}
```

## Command reference

The CLI discovers the entrypoint in the CWD (`flake.nix` → `shell.nix` → `default.nix`),
overridable with `-f`. Each `nput.<name>` is an independent profile; `<name> = default` is
resolved by `nput apply` when the name is omitted.

```bash
nput apply [<name>]            # apply nput.<name> (omitted = nput.default); builds, commits a new generation, places
nput apply <name> --dryrun     # read-only plan: place/replace/remove/conflict/no-op, zero side effects
nput apply <name> --recopy     # also overwrite every copy target from its src unconditionally
nput apply --manifest <farm>   # apply a pre-built link-farm directly (no entrypoint discovery / eval / build)
nput apply --all               # apply every nput.* in lexicographic order; continues past failures
nput apply --all --project-root # apply only projectRoot configs (also --home-root / --system-root)
nput reset <name> [target...]  # tear down placements (no profile change); target omitted = all entries
nput reset <name> --dryrun     # show what would be removed; zero side effects
nput rollback <name>           # roll back to the previous generation (home mode only; name required)
nput list-generations <name>   # list generations (home mode only)
nput list-generations --all    # list generations for all home-mode configs
nput gitignore <name>          # print placement targets for .gitignore to stdout (no writes; project mode only)
nput gitignore --all           # sorted + deduped targets for all projectRoot configs
nput prune                     # delete the orphan profile series whose recorded root is gone (no name; lists the roots and confirms)
nput prune --dryrun            # show the series that would be deleted; zero side effects
nput init <template>           # wrapper over `nix flake init -t github:yasunori0418/nput#<template>`
```

### Global flags

```text
-f, --file <path>   # specify the entrypoint explicitly (overrides auto-discovery)
--root <path>       # override the resolved root in any mode
--no-wait           # on lock contention, skip instead of waiting (for shellHook; explicit apply blocks by default)
-v, --verbose       # print the placement report (summary + per-target lines); default is silent on success
--version           # print the embedded version and exit (cobra default format `nput version X.Y.Z`; no short flag, since -v is --verbose)
--debug             # reveal the internal nix commands on stderr (for troubleshooting)
--project-root      # --all qualifier: only projectRoot configs (also --home-root / --system-root)
--recopy            # apply qualifier: overwrite every copy target from src
--manifest <path>   # apply only: apply a pre-built link-farm directly
-y, --yes           # skip the confirmation prompt of a destructive command (reset / prune; for scripts / CI)
```

### Output and exit codes

- **Silent on success by default** ("silence is golden"). The placement report, try-lock
  skip notices, and the `apply --all` summary are **not** printed unless you pass `-v` /
  `--verbose`. Pass `-v` to opt into the report on stderr.
- **`--debug`** reveals the internal nix commands (verbosity `-v` and debugging are
  orthogonal). There is **no `--quiet`** (removed when success became silent by default).
- **`--json`** writes a [niface](https://github.com/yasunori0418/niface)-conformant JSON
  envelope (a single document) to stdout at command completion — the machine-readable
  second contract, orthogonal to `-v` (every subcommand carries its payload; `--all` lists one
  `SubjectResult` per config. `reset --dryrun` is the one path still on the minimal shape).
- **Stream discipline**: stdout is reserved for machine-readable output (`gitignore`
  listings, `apply --dryrun` plans) — printed even at the default verbosity, so
  `nput gitignore <name> >> .gitignore` and `nput apply <name> --dryrun | ...` pipe safely.
  **Warnings (e.g. foreign symlinks) and errors always go to stderr** and are never
  silenced.

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | success / no-op / `--no-wait` try-lock skip |
| `1` | general error (eval error, engine runtime error, `apply --all` partial failure) |
| `2` | `apply --dryrun` detected a conflict (usable as a CI pre-gate) |

### Behavior notes

- **Idempotent.** Re-applying converges to the same result. For symlinks, nput
  conservatively removes only the stale links it recorded as placing that still point where
  the record says — it never touches your real files or foreign links. Existing nput
  symlinks are replaced; a foreign symlink is replaced with a warning; a real file or
  directory at the target is an error (no overwrite).
- **Generations** ride on nput's own Nix profile (`nix-env --profile <dir>`). Switch to an
  arbitrary generation, prune, and GC via the standard `nix-env` / `nix-collect-garbage`
  against the profile path. project mode skips committing a new generation when the
  link-farm is unchanged (but still repairs drifted entries via `lstat`).
- **`apply --all`** applies each config independently (each is atomic on its own profile),
  continues past failures, and exits non-zero if any failed. It is **not** atomic as a
  whole.
- **`reset`** is a filesystem-only teardown: it removes nput-managed symlinks
  (conservatively) **and** deletes copy targets (the only explicit way to remove a copy). It
  requires a name (`--all` is not supported), requires confirmation or `-y`, and leaves the
  profile/generations untouched — entries still in the config are re-placed on the next
  apply.

## Comparison with other tools

The axis is not "feature presence" but **"hide placement behind a module abstraction, or
expose it as a pure function you control."**

| Tool | Role | Approach | Difference from nput |
|---|---|---|---|
| npins / niv | source version pinning | — | does not place files (orthogonal — compose with nput) |
| home-manager `home.file` | file placement + generations | module (generate / declare) | requires HM; whole-environment model; the file module cannot be extracted standalone |
| `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` (HM) | out-of-store symlink | helper inside a module | HM-only; nput provides an equivalent as a dependency-free explicit function |
| nixpkgs `linkFarm` / `symlinkJoin` | store-internal symlink trees | pure function | output stays *inside* the store; never placed at an arbitrary out-of-store path (nput uses it internally) |
| `nix profile` | generation management | — | placement target is fixed at `~/.nix-profile`; no arbitrary-path placement (nput rides on it) |
| `systemd.tmpfiles` (`L`) | declarative symlink to an arbitrary path | module (NixOS) | low-level, NixOS-only, no copy / generations / fetch abstraction |
| numtide/system-manager | non-NixOS `/etc` + systemd + packages | module (`lib.evalModules`) | overlapping domain but the **opposite** approach; no arbitrary-path placement, HOME dotfiles, or subdirectory extraction |
| `git clone` (shell) | clone and place | imperative | no reproducibility or Nix integration |
| **nput** | independent placement of fetched sources + generations + explicit out-of-store | **pure function, user-managed** | — |

No single existing tool is nearly identical. The building blocks (symlink farm, nix
profile, out-of-store, arbitrary-path symlink) all exist, but nput is the only one that
bundles them as "fetch-agnostic + non-generating + per-entry application + HM-independent
pure-function core + cross-platform shared schema + arbitrary-path placement × generation
management." In particular nput does **not** compete with system-manager: the domains
(packages / systemd / `/etc`) overlap, but the philosophy ("hide in a module" vs. "expose
as a pure function") differs at the design level. For a real distro base, system / service /
package layers would be delegated to or combined with system-manager, while nput stays a
**granular arbitrary-path placement primitive**.

## MVP status

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Standalone CLI (`apply` / `reset` / `rollback` / `list-generations` / `gitignore` / `prune` / `init`) | implemented (core) |
| project mode (`projectRoot`) | implemented (core) |
| home mode (`homeRoot`) | implemented |
| home-manager module | implemented — single profile (fixed name `default`); no role separation |
| Generations / rollback (home mode) | implemented |
| copy (place-once) / out-of-store symlink | implemented |
| flake-parts module | implemented |
| `manifest.json` schema | v1 only; no migration / backward-compat machinery yet |
| `--json` machine-readable output | implemented — niface-conformant envelope on every subcommand, with per-command payloads (items / changes / info) and one `SubjectResult` per config under `--all`; `reset --dryrun` still emits the minimal shape |
| NixOS / nix-darwin modules | future |
| system mode (`systemRoot` = `/`) | future (seam only; evaluation-time error if selected today) |

**Known limitations / honest caveats**

- The function-based "package install + PATH" mechanism for the distro north-star is
  undefined and out of scope.
- Boot / init / filesystem / partition layers are not nput's domain.
- Removing a clone leaves an orphan profile directory under
  `<state>/nix/profiles/nput/` (the store is freed by `nix-collect-garbage`, but the
  profile directory remains). `nput prune` deletes the series whose recorded root no longer
  exists; it lists the root paths and asks before deleting anything.
- The home-manager module cannot separate roles into multiple profiles in the MVP — use the
  standalone CLI for that.

## Migrating from nput

nput is being renamed to **layat** on or after **2026-09-22**. The rename is a breaking change
and **no compatibility shim is provided**. Why the name changed, the rejected candidates and the
policy behind the notice period are recorded in
[`docs/adr/0054-rename-nput-to-layat.md`](docs/adr/0054-rename-nput-to-layat.md).

### Staying on the old name

If you would rather not migrate yet, pin the last nput-named state:

```nix
inputs.nput.url = "github:yasunori0418/nput/legacy-nput";
```

`legacy-nput` is an annotated git tag on the merge commit of the notice PR — a tag, not a GitHub
Release. GitHub
keeps redirecting the old repository URL after the rename, so this pin keeps resolving.

### What you have to change

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `github:yasunori0418/nput` | `github:yasunori0418/layat` |
| `nput.*` module options (`nput.enable`, `nput.entries`, `nput.backup.*`) | `layat.*` |
| `home.activation.nput` | `home.activation.layat` |
| `perSystem.nput.<name>` / `#nput.<system>.<name>` | `perSystem.layat.<name>` / `#layat.<system>.<name>` |
| `packages.nput` / the `nput` binary | `packages.layat` / the `layat` binary |
| `--json`: `E_NPUT_*` / `W_NPUT_*`, `tool.name = "nput"` | `E_LAYAT_*` / `W_LAYAT_*`, `tool.name = "layat"` |
| `<target>.nput-backup` | `<target>.layat-backup` |

The `--json` codes are the one change consumers cannot ignore: niface requires the
`E_<TOOL>_<NAME>` shape, so the prefix moves with the tool name.

### Old generations: migrate or drop

> The commands in this subsection are for **after** the rename. Until then `layat` does not

nput's generations live in `<state>/nix/profiles/nput/`; layat reads
`<state>/nix/profiles/layat/`. Nothing is migrated for you: layat neither moves that directory
nor reads it. Decide which of the two you want **before the first `layat apply`** — the
migration below moves the whole directory into place and assumes
`<state>/nix/profiles/layat/` does not exist yet. Check that it doesn't, and move it aside if it
does: `mv` into an existing directory does not fail — it silently nests `nput/` inside it and
exits 0. Whichever you pick, any `<target>.nput-backup` files are left behind; remove them by
hand once you are satisfied with the new placement.

#### Migrate the generations

Moving the directory alone is not enough. The generation links are protected from the Nix
garbage collector by *indirect roots* under `/nix/var/nix/gcroots/auto/` that point at the
**old absolute paths**; after a plain `mv` every one of them dangles and the next GC removes
them, taking the moved link farms — including the previous generation's `manifest.json` —
with it. Re-register a root per generation link in the same step as the `mv`, so that no GC runs
in between. The re-registration recreates every link and resets its mtime; if the original
generation dates matter to you, copy the old directory aside first (`cp -a` preserves symlink
timestamps) and restore the moved links from that copy with `touch -h -r` afterwards.

```sh
old="${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/nix/profiles/nput"
new="${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/nix/profiles/layat"
mv "$old" "$new" && find "$new" -name 'profile-*-link' -type l \
  -exec sh -c 'nix-store --add-root "$1" --indirect -r "$(readlink "$1")" >/dev/null' _ {} \;
```

The old roots — the ones still pointing into `<state>/nix/profiles/nput/` — are left alone;
they disappear at the next GC.

Check the result with `layat list-generations <name>` — home mode only, as with `nput`
(`default` under home-manager; if you applied the config with `--root`, pass the same `--root`).
The old generations should be listed.

The previous generation's manifest came along, so the first `layat apply` after a migration is
an ordinary apply — no foreign warnings, and stale removal keeps working.

#### Drop the generations

If you do not care about the history, remove the old state directory:

```sh
rm -rf "${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/nix/profiles/nput"
```

**Delete it rather than leaving it behind.** As long as the generation links exist, their
indirect roots keep the old store paths alive and the garbage collector will never reclaim
them. Once the links are gone the `gcroots/auto/` entries are pruned at the next GC and the
store paths become collectable.

With no previous generation to read, the first `layat apply` starts at generation 1 and behaves
as if every target had been placed by a stranger:

- **symlink entries are overwritten**, last-write-wins, with a `W_LAYAT_FOREIGN_SYMLINK`
  warning. The run does not fail.
- **copy entries are skipped**, because a real file already occupies the target. Pass
  `--backup` to move the existing file aside and place the copy.
- **targets that existed only in an old nput generation are left in place.** Stale removal
  needs the previous generation's manifest, and layat has none.

## Documentation

`docs/` is a three-layer structure: **README → overview document → item**. The normative
content lives in the items (one claim per Markdown file, with YAML frontmatter); the overview
documents are the entry point for reading through, giving the big picture and an index into the
items. The overview documents are maintained in Japanese.

Overview documents (big picture + index):

- `docs/concept.md` — concept (index into solution / use_case items), design philosophy,
  north-star, comparison with existing tools, how the design evolved
- `docs/design.md` — design (index into design items)
- `docs/spec.md` — specification (index into requirement items)
- `docs/glossary.md` — canonical English terminology

Items (where the normative content lives):

| Directory | Type | Prefix |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/solution/` | solution | `SOL` |
| `docs/use-cases/` | use_case | `UC` |
| `docs/requirements/` | requirement | `REQ` |
| `docs/design/` | design | `DSG` |
| `docs/infrastructure/` | infrastructure | `INF` |
| `docs/adr/` | adr (kept out of the tree) | `ADR` |

Items form a graph (`docs/model.yaml` defines the types and relations), traversed with `sara`
from the devShell:

```bash
nix develop ./dev --command sara check    # validate the whole graph
```

For querying the graph (`sara query`, which takes a full ID) see `docs/agents/domain.md`.
