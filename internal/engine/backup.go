// backup applies the planner's Backup actions: rename each occupying foreign filesystem object
// aside (TargetAbs → BackupAbs = "<target>.<suffix>") so the placement stage that follows lands
// on an absent target (→ ADR-0045, issue #169). It runs after PreRemove and before Place /
// materializeCopies, mirroring recopyAll's rename-aside (asidePath / journalRenamedAside): the
// rename is a same-parent-directory metadata-only operation that cannot fail partway under
// ENOSPC. Undo restores it with the undoRestoreBackup inverse (remove whatever this run placed at
// TargetAbs, then rename BackupAbs back) — unlike recopy's aside, a successful commit does NOT
// clean up BackupAbs; it is the user's backup and stays on disk (→ ADR-0044, ADR-0045).
//
// The backup destination's absence was already checked at plan time (→ planner.appendBackup), but
// a re-check immediately before the rename guards the same plan/execute TOCTOU window PreRemove's
// reverifyStale guards for stale removal: a concurrent writer could have created BackupAbs between
// planning and this run reaching it. Unlike PreRemove's drift handling, there is nothing here to
// "keep as-is" on drift — the destination existing at all means a prior backup would be silently
// clobbered, so this aborts loudly (→ ADR-0017 idempotent re-run convergence).
