# Triage Labels

The five triage labels in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label             | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`    | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`      | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent` | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human` | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`         | Will not be actioned                     |

## Structural labels (not triage roles)

These are orthogonal to the triage roles above — they describe what an issue *is*, not
what it needs next. An issue carries both (e.g. `epic` + `needs-triage`).

| Label      | Color     | Meaning                                                     |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tracking` | (default) | Milestone-level issue aggregating epics (e.g. #147)         |
| `epic`     | `#6f42c1` | Bundles sub-issues under a tracking issue                   |
| `task`     | `#0e8a16` | A sub-issue under an epic or tracking issue — the work unit |

The three are mutually exclusive: an issue is at most one of them. A standalone issue
(a one-off bug or docs fix belonging to no epic) carries none.

All three are kept on closed issues, so `--state all` queries list the project's full
history: `label:epic` for every epic it has had, `label:task` for every work unit. See
`issue-tracker.md` for when to apply them.
