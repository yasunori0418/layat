// removeStale applies the planner's Remove actions, re-verifying the conservative
// invariant against the real FS immediately before each unlink. The plan already
// restricts removals to "symlinks recorded in the previous generation that still
// point at the recorded dest", but placement (and any concurrent change) runs
// between planning and removal, so the stale-remover re-checks lstat/readlink and
// unlinks only when the invariant still holds; drifted targets are kept with a
// warning (→ ADR-0002, ADR-0006, docs/spec.md "stale removal targets and safety invariant").
// After each unlink it walks the parent chain toward root, pruning ancestors left
// empty by the removal (→ Issue #174, #172 (D4)); a prune failure is folded
// into the same keep+warn policy as a drifted target, since the target itself is
// already gone and nothing is lost by leaving a leftover empty dir.

// preRemove removes the self-recorded stale filesystem objects the planner scheduled to clear a
// placement target: ancestor symlinks (→ ADR-0046), and — generalized under ADR-0047 — leaf
// symlinks and now-empty directories beneath an occupying real directory, and a symlink replaced
// by method change (symlink→copy). It runs *before* place so the target lands empty/absent
// instead of resolving through stale content (local ordering exception to ADR-0006). Removed
// objects are folded into result.Removed (Unlink) / result.Pruned (Rmdir): the migration is
// silent by default and surfaced only under -v, never as a warning (→ ADR-0031).
//
// Unlike removeStale — the last stage, where keeping a drifted link is harmless — drift here is
// *not* safe to skip: placement was planned assuming these objects are gone (children as
// unconditional new placements, or the target itself as absent), so continuing on drift would
// nest/place through it (e.g. a symlink swapped to a foreign, writable dir) and re-open the
// ADR-0015 §4 pollution that place/ensureParentDir do not re-guard. So on drift it aborts loudly
// instead of skipping for both Unlink and Rmdir (→ ADR-0017, ADR-0046, ADR-0047 D3); an idempotent
// re-run re-plans against the current FS and converges.
//
// Unlike removeStale / reset — where a removal can be the final state of that target — PreRemove
// never walks pruneEmptyAncestors (Issue #174's ancestor-pruning helper). Every PreRemove action
// exists to clear the way for a placement (place / materializeCopies) that runs immediately
// afterward in the same Apply, at or beneath the same directory: pruning outer ancestors here
// would just have that placement step's ensureParentDir immediately recreate them, and — for the
// generalized real-dir-target and multi-leaf migrations (→ ADR-0047) — pruning mid-batch would
// race the planner's own explicit, already-ordered bottom-up Rmdir actions for the same
// directories (classifyDirMigration lists children before parents up to the placement target
// itself; nothing outside that tree needs pruning here).
