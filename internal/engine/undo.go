// Package-level undo journal (→ ADR-0044, issue #168): apply's FS-mutating stages — PreRemove,
// place, materializeCopies, removeStale, and the generation-skip drift repair — each push one
// undoOp per successful FS write onto applier.journal. If any stage in the same Apply/Rollback
// call later fails, the journal accumulated so far is unwound in reverse (LIFO) order, restoring
// the pre-apply state before the error is returned. Once `nix-env --set` (commit) succeeds the
// journal is discarded by the caller: FS changes are then part of the new generation, and undoing
// them is rollback's job, not this run's.
//
// Process crashes (SIGKILL, power loss) are out of scope: the journal lives only in memory. That
// gap is intentionally left to the existing backstop — an uncommitted generation plus idempotent
// re-run convergence (→ ADR-0006, ADR-0017) — rather than a persisted WAL (→ ADR-0044 §4).

// undoKind identifies which inverse operation an undoOp performs.
