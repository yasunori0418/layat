# Marker constructors (→ ADR-0001, ADR-0004, ADR-0005, ADR-0007, ADR-0010).
#
# A marker is a "container that carries the kind for runtime resolution", not syntactic sugar that returns a path string.
# Since both `src` (a derivation) and a marker are attrsets and cannot be distinguished structurally, a marker
# carries a `_layatMarker` discriminator tag, and the `check` of the custom optionType in `lib/types.nix` distinguishes them.
# `_layatMarker` stays within Nix evaluation and is never leaked into `manifest.json` (the Go contract is a clean enum・→ ADR-0010).
#
# No dependencies (pure attrset constructors that do not even require nixpkgs.lib).

  # The argument is an absolute path string fixed at Nix eval time. Actual link creation is the engine's runtime responsibility.
