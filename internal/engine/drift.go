// Generation skip + lstat drift repair (project mode only · → ADR-0005, ADR-0017,
// docs/spec.md "project mode generations").
//
// The devShell / direnv shellHook runs on every shell re-entry, so if the new
// link-farm derivation is identical to the previous generation, no new generation
// is committed (--set is omitted · avoiding unbounded generation growth). However,
// "same derivation ⇒ same FS" breaks under foreign tool rewrites, so instead of a
// full no-op each entry's target is lstat-checked and only drifted entries are re-linked.

// generationUnchanged reports whether the new link-farm is the same store derivation
// as the previous generation (the one the profile link points at). It resolves the
// chain profile link → generation link → link-farm store path and compares it with the
// new link-farm's store path. If either cannot be resolved it returns an error and the
// caller falls back to the safe side (normal apply = new generation commit).

// repairDrift performs the lstat drift repair during a generation skip. Of the plan the
// planner computed from the current FS state, it re-converges **only** the drifted entries,
// performing neither stale removal nor a generation commit.
//
//   - symlink: re-links only PlaceNew (target gone) and PlaceForeign (foreign rewrite).
//     PlaceReplace is "a symlink pointing at the recorded dest" = no drift, so it is left
//     untouched (→ ADR-0017). The foreign-rewrite warning has already been emitted by the
//     caller via emitWarnings(plan.Warnings).
//   - copy: planner.Copies contains only place-once actions for absent targets, so reflecting
//     it gives "copy reverts place-once only when the target is absent". Content diffs (user
//     edits) produce no CopyAction and are left untouched (→ docs/spec.md "project mode
//     generations" · ADR-0022). On --recopy, recopyAll overwrites unconditionally (recopy is
//     an opt-in outside generations).
//
// plan.PreRemove is structurally empty on this path: every PreRemove source — ancestor→children
// migration, an occupying real directory fully migrated, or a symlink→copy method change (→
// ADR-0046, ADR-0047) — requires the new manifest to differ from the previous generation's at the
// affected target, which changes the link-farm derivation. So generationUnchanged is never true
// for a plan with a non-empty PreRemove, and the gen-skip branch above is not taken. The drift
// repair therefore has no pre-removal to run.
//
// plan.Backup has no such invariant: apply --backup's rename-aside fires on a foreign occupant at
// a target, which can appear at any time regardless of whether the manifest/derivation changed (a
// foreign tool can drop a file at the target between shell re-entries). So a gen-skip run backs up
// and places fresh exactly like normal apply, instead of asserting Backup is empty (→ ADR-0045, issue #169).

	// non-empty PreRemove. If that ever breaks, silently dropping the pre-removal would let place
	// nest/place through stale content still occupying the target — fail loudly instead (→ ADR-0046, ADR-0047).
